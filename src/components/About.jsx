      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm James.<br></br><br></br>In a past life, I was all about music. I've been in a (quite unpopular) jam band, written some wild contemporary classical compositions, and been first chair double bassist in an orchestra. But then life threw me a curveball, and I found myself in the world of mental health counseling.<br></br><br></br>Helping others navigate life's ups and downs became my passion. It was an extremely rewarding experience.<br></br><br></br>Now, I've added a new chapter to my story â€“ web development! I recently wrapped up my journey at Actualize Coding Bootcamp, where I learned to use many technologies, including Rails, React, databases, and Bootstrap.<br></br><br></br>So here I am, blending creativity, connection, and problem-solving in the digital world. It's a wild ride, and I'm loving every minute of it! Let's build something amazing together!
