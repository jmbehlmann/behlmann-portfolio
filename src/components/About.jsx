      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm James.</p>
        <p>In a past life, I was all about music. I've been in a (quite unpopular) jam band, written some wild contemporary classical compositions, and been first chair double bassist in an orchestra. But then life threw me a curveball, and I found myself in the world of mental health counseling.</p>
        <p>Helping others navigate life's ups and downs became my passion. It was an extremely rewarding experience.</p>
        <p>Now, I've added a new chapter to my story – web development! I recently wrapped up my journey at Actualize Coding Bootcamp, where I learned to use many technologies, including Rails, React, databases, and Bootstrap.</p>
        <p>In addition to programming, I like to cook overly elaborate meals for 2, hike up mountains, and cover obscure electronic music on hardware. </p>
        <p>So here I am, blending creativity, connection, and problem-solving in the digital world. It's a wild ride, and I'm loving every minute of it! Let's build something amazing together!
